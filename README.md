## About me 

Hey there! My name is Andrés, Data Scientist and Economist. I have experience working on data analytics in the fields of Sustainable Development Goals and Infrastructure sector. As I became passionate about problem solving through data, I decided to become a Data Scientist. Through Machine Learning models, different statistical tools and data visualization, I seek valuable information through pattern recognition in specific topics.

## 📚 Projects

1. Master´s Thesis: Data Science in weightlifting sports performance with R, proving that a logistic regression can predict up to 85% of the athletes reaching podiums.
2. Flight delays project: Using a Random Forest classifier and oversampling techniques, determined the variables that predicted flight delays with an 89% accuracy.
