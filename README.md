## About me 

Hey there! My name is Andrés, Data Scientist and Economist. I have experience working on data analytics in the fields of Sustainable Development Goals and Infrastructure sector. As I became passionate about problem solving through data, I decided to become a Data Scientist. Through Machine Learning models, different statistical tools and data visualization, I seek valuable information through pattern recognition in specific topics.

## 📚 Projects

1. Predictive Factors of Powerlifting Competition Performance (Master´s Thesis): A Logistic Regression model on R to predict athletes reaching the podium with up to 79% accuracy and 85% AUC. Optimized through threshold adjustment and feature engineering. 
2. Flight Delays project: Using a Random Forest classifier and oversampling techniques with Python, determined the variables that predicted flight delays with a 89% accuracy.
3. Oncologic cases: Detecting patients with tumors with a KNN model with an 85% accuracy rate using R. 
4. Lego Sets project: Report with visual storytelling with R on Lego sets. 
5. Telecom company study: Through statistical inference, determined that customer leakage can be explained up to 67% by customer seniority. 
6. Data analysis of small businesses: With SQL Snowflake, extracted meaningful data of small businesses in relation to sellings, economical values, returns and countries of origin.
